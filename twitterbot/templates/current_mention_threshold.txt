{%- if current_threshold -%}
I'm currently programmed to notify you whenever a tweet's owner has more than **{{ current_threshold }}** followers.

You can change this threshold number by doing:
**@{{ botname }} mention <number>**

Or I can stop notifying you altogether if you do:
**@{{ botname }} mention stop**
{%- else -%}
I'm not currently programmed to notify you. You can change this by doing:
**@{{ botname }} mention <number>**

Then, I'll notify you whenever a tweet's owner has more than {{ current_threshold }} followers.
